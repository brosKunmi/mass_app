  static const String disciple = '''
A call to discipleship in the Christian context is not a call of commitment to any human or human like figure, church or organization. Rather, it is a call to submission, commitment,growth and transformation which only transpires as we gradually and consistently learn to fix our gaze on the one who is the author and finisher of our faith.

The platform of discipleship is for those who are willing to:
* experience the joy of true fellowship.
* grow into the likeness of Christ (2Cor2:16).
* fulfill their true destiny in Christ (Eph2:10).
* rise above the statusquo(John 12:32).

Are you ready to go beyond the ordinary?

I dare you to join this community of believers as we daily learn to follow Christ and draw others to do the same.
